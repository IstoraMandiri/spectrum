Spectrum is an open source react-redux app for developing dapp UIs.

Spectrum is designed to make life easy for dapp and contract developers by abstracting away the repetitive parts of Ethereum development (keystores, tokens, networks managemnt and more). When developing a on Spectrum, you can focus on writing the UI for your contracts by leveraging a library of re-usable web3-specific components and applying your branding using the beautiful Semantic UI LESS framework.

Spectrum builds to a static JS bundle, which can be served anywhere; it doesn't even need a server.
